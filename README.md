# VariableTriggersScripts
A collection of Variable Triggers scripts that I made/worked on in my time as 
staff on the Minecraft server Talabrek's Ultimate Skyblock.

## Information
Variable Triggers is a Minecraft plugin that adds a kind of scripting language that
allows the developer to manipulate variables, blocks, etc in the game.

Variable Triggers is a huge part of Talabrek's Ultimate Skyblock so I spent a large amount
of time working on these scripts that allow things like Dungeons to run so that players
can have fun playing in them. I've also worked on other fun features like Marriage that
allows two players to have a "relationship" together and get cool perks.

As fun as it was, I have since left the staff team of Talabrek's Ultimate Skyblock due to
internal conflicts. Minecraft is a game that is constantly changing so some of my scripts in
the past have faced errors, but thankfully the current staff team continue to update my scripts
so that my projects will not be depreceated from the server. 

This GitHub repository assists with the version control of these scripts and allows the staff 
team and I to manage changes easily.
